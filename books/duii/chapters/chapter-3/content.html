    <p>This chapter is designed to provide lawyers’ assistants with the information necessary to handle procedural matters pertaining to DUII cases. Assistants and lawyers can benefit by defining those duties which assistants can handle, thereby lessening the need for constant communication and dictation, freeing time up for the attorney. This also creates a more responsible and interesting position for the assistant.

    <p>The assistant generally has the initial contact with the new client by taking the incoming telephone call. Most callers are open about their need for legal assistance. Some callers are more hesitant to discuss the matter with anyone but the attorney. With the attorney’s permission, assistants can perform the “pre-interview” interview. Indicate to the caller that perhaps you can obtain some initial information that will help the attorney understand what his/her case is about when the attorney returns the call. Also, if the attorney handles the case, you will have the information needed to set up your file. You will need to obtain the following information (also see Appendix A, DUII Telephone Intake, and the client-related forms in Part 2, Checklists and Forms, begining on pg 3–17):
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><blockquote><p>Name, address and phone numbers (work, home, cell, and email).</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Exact date citation was issued.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>County in which citation was issued.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Date of first appearance and court (i.e., municipal, county, federal, tribunal).</p></blockquote></li></ul>
    <ul>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether a breath test was taken or refused.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether a blood test or urinalysis was taken or refused.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Test result, if known.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether caller was involved in an accident.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>If so, was anyone injured? Get names of all involved for a conflict check.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether or not the caller is a resident of Oregon.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether the caller has prior DUII convictions, prior diversion entries, prior breath test refusals or failures, prior alcohol treatment program participation, etc.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
    <ul>
    <li><blockquote><p>Military or non-military.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether currently on probation or parole.</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether there was a passenger in the caller’s vehicle.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
    <ul>
    <li><blockquote><p>Whether caller has a Commercial Driver License.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
    <p>The caller will be asking a lot of questions. It is important to remember that an assistant cannot give legal advice.
    </p><p>After obtaining the necessary information, inform the caller of the following:
    </p><p>1. When you determine implied consent status, ask the caller if a DMV hearing has been requested. The caller has 10 days (not counting the day of arrest) to make a request for a hearing. This request must be received at the DMV Hearings Branch in Salem by 5 p.m. on the 10th day following arrest. If the 10th day falls on a holiday or weekend, the deadline is the next business day. This hearing is to contest the proposed suspension by DMV for either failure or refusal of a test.
    </p><p>2. If no request for a hearing has been filed, schedule an appointment to see the prospective client within the 10-day period for requesting a hearing. If the caller cannot get in within the 10-day period, obtain information to make the hearing request for the caller and make an appointment as soon as possible. This request does not obligate the caller or the attorney, it only protects the caller’s right to a hearing.
    </p><p>a. If the caller doesn’t hire the attorney, she can still attend the hearing.
    </p><p>b. Even if the caller is currently suspended for another reason, a hearing request may protect her from further suspension and is an excellent discovery tool.
    </p><p>c. The caller should be told that in the event no hearing is requested, suspension will automatically take effect 30 days from the date of arrest. Ask caller to bring all papers that the officer gave her when the caller comes to initial appointment.

    <p>The hearing request can be made <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/Pages/Email_forms/implied_consent_hearing.aspx"><span class="underline">online</span></a>, by fax, by mail or can be hand delivered. For a sample hearing request, go to Part 2, Checklists and Forms, pg. 3–53. A sample reequest is on pg. 3–54.<br>
    The request should include:
    </p><p>1. Full name of client.
    </p><p>2. Client’s mailing address. (Be sure to check with client on this, because current address may be different than that shown on implied consent form. DMV will mail notice of hearing to the address you give them.)
    </p><p>3. Driver’s license number and state of issuance.
    </p><p>4. Date of birth.
    </p><p>5. Date and county of arrest.
    </p><p>6. Attorney contact information and availability: dates, portions of days (morning, afternoon, 10–2, etc.).
    </p><p>7. Request an in-person hearing. Otherwise, the automatic default will be a telephonic hearing. An in-person hearing will provide a better opportunity to properly question the officer and will increase the likelihood that they do not show up within 15 minutes of the scheduled hearing time.
    </p><p>8. If an interpreter is needed specify what language.
    </p><p>9. The DMV Hearings Case Management Unit also requests a brief statement of the issues you intend to raise at the hearing. A general statement such as the following should be provided: “We will be challenging the legality of the stop and the legality of the arrest in this case pursuant to <i>Bish v. MVD</i>, 97 or App 648 (1989), and <i>Pooler v. MVD</i>, 306 Or 47 (1988).”
    </p><p>If client requested his own hearing prior to hiring you, they may not have requested an in-person hearing and will not have known your schedule. If the client did not request an in-person hearing it will still be scheduled as an in-person hearing if the officer checked that request on the ICCR. If the hearing has not been scheduled, when you fax the Offices of Administrative Hearings with your representation letter, you should indicate you want an in-person hearing. You can also send your availability to the OAH after a client has made a request. If the hearing has already been scheduled for a telephonic hearing, the OAH will not change this.
    </p><p>The initial request for a hearing is sent to the DMV. Once they have determined the request is within the 10-day time limit, the case is transferred to the Offices of Administrative Hearings. Pay attention to the county of arrest—a hearing in another area will require travel time. The OAH will try to accommodate the attorney’s schedule.
    </p><p>Under certain circumstances, you may file a motion with the Offices of Administrative Hearings to allow a late hearing.
    </p><p>Establishing rapport with the person who does the scheduling in your area is advised.

If the officer is unavailable and the hearing is rescheduled, the client’s license suspension is withdrawn until the outcome of the hearing. Reasons for allowing the department to reschedule the hearing are covered in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 813.440</a> and includes the inability of the attorney to appear due to the attorney’s illness, vacation or scheduling conflict arising from other court or administrative hearing appearances.

Pursuant to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 183.413</a>, a member of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard and National Guard) may be subject to the protection of the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The SCRA provides certain protections to servicemembers and their dependents, if specific conditions are met. If your client qualifies, he or she may be entitled to have the license suspension matter stayed. You will need to get a copy of the client’s service orders as it pertains to the specific condition.

    <p>When setting up a file for a new client, it is important the file be of an adequate size to contain the volume of material these cases can generate. Multipart folders or notebooks allow room for organizing information.
    </p><p>Along with the client’s address and phone number it is helpful to include the address and phone numbers of the court clerk and city and district attorneys.
    </p><p>Note: When your office takes on a case in a county where the attorney does not normally practice, contact the clerk of that court. Ask the clerk about their procedures, special appearances or filing requirements. Read the Supplemental Trial Court Rules that apply to that judicial district. It is very important to ask how the diversion deadline is calculated. Never assume it will always be 30 days after the initial appearance date. Asking in advance can save you a lot of time and headaches. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or let people know that you are unfamiliar with some procedures. They are almost always willing to help if you express your desire to do things right.

    <p>One cannot say too much for these!
    </p><p>Checklists allow much to be done without a great deal of attorney time. In a busy office, having checklists marked indicating what to do means that case preparation goes on in the absence of the attorney. With a checklist used by the attorney, the assistant can prepare and transmit the fee agreement, request discovery, request a DMV hearing, send initial correspondence to witnesses, advise court of representation, prepare standard motions, etc. A checklist also allows the attorney to know at a glance that things have been done. A checklist could include the following (see Part 2, Checklists and Forms, and Appendix B):
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><blockquote><p>DMV hearing request</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Driving record</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Discovery request and payment to city/district attorney</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Letter of representation to court</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Not-guilty letter to court (in lieu of first appearance, if acceptable)</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Jail records (including mug shot and medical screening form)</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Audio/videotape recording of arrest/field sobriety tests</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Communications/911 tape</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Medical records</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Court documents regarding prior convictions</p></blockquote></li>

    <li><blockquote><p>DMV recordings ordered (DMV retains them for only six months after the hearing)</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Routine motions</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Discovery to state</p></blockquote></li>
    <li><blockquote><p>Expert witnesses needed and obtained</p></blockquote></li>

    <p>By sending copies of everything to the client, whether motions or correspondence, you keep your client advised of what is going on. Sending the police reports to the client with a request that he or she contact the attorney after reviewing them gives the client an opportunity to go over the materials thoroughly. When sending police reports and discovery to the client, you <i>must</i> redact all personal identifiers of victims and witnesses pursuant to ORS 135.815(4)(A). Personal identifiers are defined as a person’s address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, and numbers of accounts at financial institutions or on credit cards. ORS 135.815(5)(A).

    <p>It is a good practice to request a copy of the CD of the DMV hearing. Since the Hearings Branch keeps the recordings for only six months, doing this automatically ensures that you will have the recording.
    </p><p>When retained to represent the client on the DUII, the testimony portions of the recordings can then be transcribed for use at trial or for motion hearings.
    </p><p>These recordings can be obtained by writing the Hearings Branch, Attention: Record Services, with a check. You may also want to set up an account for CDs, and then you can fax in your request. If you have an account with DMV, you can fax your request to (503) 588-0155 or (503) 588-0165.
    </p><p>Note: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 813.324</a> requires that the party who intends to use a DMV hearing recording or transcript provide a copy to the attorney for the other party at least seven days prior to the first date set for trial. The sole remedy for failure to comply with this statute is <i>exclusion</i>, absent a showing of “good cause.”

    <p>Having the docket handled by the assistant can save the attorney a great deal of time. The assistant usually takes calls from the court and others to set matters and can eliminate conflicts by catching them before appearances are set. The assistant generally opens the mail and can enter trial, motion and other dates on dockets as she or he handles the mail, notifying clients and witnesses and issuing necessary subpoenas. The assistant can determine conflicts and bring them to the attention of the attorney who will advise how to handle them (reset one case or another). It is also important to let the court know when your client needs an interpreter in advance of the hearing or trial. Do not assume that they will know this.

    <p>When you send your letter or online notification to DMV requesting an implied consent hearing, be sure to request discovery. The discovery you receive from DMV will not be complete. You will receive only documents pertaining to the implied consent suspension (implied consent form, Intoxilyzer checklist, evidence card, permit, etc.). You will not, however, receive the officer’s written report, DUII interview form, recordings, etc. In rare instances you may receive a police report. In order to ensure you have all discovery in your hands prior to the DMV hearing, you should request it from the city or district attorney’s office, if available prior to the client being arraigned.
    </p><p>Periodically you will have a DMV hearing set and the court case has not been “filed” by the city/district attorney’s office. In this case, the city/district attorney’s office may not release the discovery because “a case has not been filed.” If you cannot get discovery from the prosecutor, call the arresting agency’s records custodian. Explain that you can not obtain the discovery from the prosecuting attorney’s office because the case has not yet been filed and that you have a DMV hearing set soon. The records custodian may agree to give them to you or you’ll be referred back to the city/district attorney’s office. If you cannot get them from the records custodian, you will need to issue a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> (see Appendix C) to the records custodian to bring them to the DMV hearing. Usually the custodian will promptly provide them to you so he or she will not have to appear at the hearing. Be sure to attach a check to the subpoena for a witness fee of $5 and mileage ($.08 per mile). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors044.html">ORS 44.415(2)</a>

    <p>Many municipal courts will accept a “not guilty” letter that allows the attorney to basically make the initial appearance by letter and set the case in the normal course. If you are dealing with a court you are not familiar with, you should always make it a practice to call and confirm their procedures. For example, in Eugene Municipal Court the first appearance can be made by letter but the client will need to watch a brief video about their legal rights within two weeks of the arraignment date. Even if you are familiar with the court, you may want to periodically check to ensure that the “rules” have not changed. It seems that “rules” are changed quite frequently without notice.
    </p><p>If the case is a felony then the client must appear at arraignment. For a misdemeanor the attorney can appear without the client, pursuant to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors134.html">ORS 134.030</a>. In this situation you will want the client to sign a “waiver of appearance” and file it with the court (see a sample letter in Part 2, pg. 3–47). Be aware that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 813.017</a> requires a client to be booked after the arraignment if they were not booked during the arrest. In this situation the attorney may appear for the client with a waiver of appearance but will need to instruct them to go in and be fingerprinted. Some courts will also require the client to sign and return a release agreement to the court after the arraignment.
    </p><p>One of the greatest collateral consequences of DUII is having a mugshot appear on the internet. Be sure to advise the client whether he or she must attend the arraignment and warn them that when they are booked they will be fingerprinted, but they may also be photographed, in which case their mugshot will appear on a Google image search of their name. The organizations that post mugshots to the internet, such as Lane County Mugshots, will typically have a process on the website for removing a mugshot, such as if the case is dismissed or for a fee. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://oregoncrimenews.com/mugshot-removal/">Oregon Crime News</a> is one such site.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

    <p><i>Call the court to determine deadline and procedures.</i> Many courts have different rules when it comes to diversion deadlines. Some courts, pursuant to statute, calculate the deadline as 30 days from the “actual” initial appearance date. If a court allows submission of a “not guilty” letter, it may calculate the 30-day deadline from the date of receipt of the letter. If not calculated correctly the client may be too late to file. Also, some courts may automatically set a diversion deadline date beyond the 30-day period. For these reasons it is absolutely necessary to call the court.
    </p><p>If you are certain that your client will be entering diversion, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/Pages/duii-diversion.aspx"><span class="underline">order a diversion packet from the court</span></a>. Most courts have a diversion packet that contains a petition and an informational sheet on the diversion program including the costs the client will have to pay. This information is useful for the client so she will know what to expect. Many of the forms are provided in Chapter 6, “Diversion.”
    </p><p>For purposes of determining diversion eligibility and for other reasons, it is sometimes necessary to obtain information on prior DUII cases. After obtaining a copy of the driver’s license record or the client’s criminal history from the city/district attorney’s office, you should request a copy of the entire case file from the trial court where client previously entered diversion.
    </p><p>Once client has entered diversion, calendar 40 days in advance of when the diversion period ends. If client has been unable to complete all of the requirements of the diversion, they are eligible for a one-time six-month extension to complete the diversion. The documents must be filed within the 30 days prior to the one-year deadline.

    <p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 813.255</a> allows an extension of diversion to be granted by the court just one time. For this reason, if the client is still in treatment, it is prudent to request the maximum allowable 180-day extension in case there are any unforeseen problems such as having to start the 90 days demonstrated sobriety anew due to a dilute urine sample.
    </p><p>Once the court has appointed an evaluator for the client, the evaluator will need the following information before the client has the evaluation:
    </p><p>• Police reports.
    </p><p>• Driving record.
    </p><p>• BAC breathalyzer report.
    </p><p>The client will also be required to attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) once he enters diversion. It’s important that he attends on the date the court enters on the diversion paperwork. If your client misses the date, you may have to request a new referral from the court. You can find VIP locations, dates, and information at Mothers Against Drunk Driving’s site <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://maddvip.org/">here</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> This website also contains links to other VIP classes in other states if your client lives out of state.

    <p>These notices are generated by the court when conditions of diversion are allegedly not met. Upon receipt, contact the court diversion clerk and determine the reason for non-compliance. In many cases a client has simply failed to pay the balance of the court fee or the court has not received confirmation of class attendance. Notify the client of the non-compliance notice and advise them that the problem needs to be corrected. If the “non-compliance” is not correctable, then the client may be terminated from diversion and sentenced on the DUII.
    </p><p>The show cause process is generally two steps. The client will be arraigned on the show cause and can enter a denial and have the matter set for a hearing. Discovery should be requested and reviewed. Some courts (usually municipal) will allow a stipulated recommendation to the court in which the client serves a sanction and the diversion remains in place. Circuit courts will generally revoke on any showing that the client violated any terms of the agreement. One of the biggest traps is blowing into an ignition interlock device (IID) with alcohol on the breath. In that situation, request and review all of the IID blow data from the IID provider and demand that the prosecution lay a proper foundation for introducing that evidence. Sometimes the IID analysis lab will be out of area and not available for the hearing.

    <p>This probationary permit may be required as a result of a license suspension in an implied consent matter or as a result of a court-ordered suspension for DUII. In the latter case, requirements for a hardship permit can vary widely, depending on the client’s prior record, date of arrest, etc. Call DMV at (503) 945-5400 (general number), or the suspensions unit at (503) 945-5037 or (503) 945-5033 with the client’s ODL number and obtain specific information for that individual from the licensing department regarding eligibility. This information is provided at no cost. The Hardship Permit application is given at Appendix E and can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/hardship.aspx">online</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
    </p><p>Historically a hardship permit was only available for driving for work, looking for work and going to treatment classes. In January of 2020 DMV greatly expanded the use of the hardship to also allow for “necessary services” including: grocery shopping one day a week, driving yourself or children to school, driving to medical appointments two days a week and caring for elderly family members.
    </p><p>The process for getting a hardship permit is as follows: The client sends the completed application and a check for $125 to DMV in Salem. After about 10 days the client will receive a letter from DMV, which they take to their local DMV office to get the hardship license. The client will have to bring proof of SR-22 insurance and proof of the installation of an IID. SR-22 insurance can increase the client’s premiums for a significant time after the need for the insurance is over, so they may want to check with a short-term SR-22 insurance provider rather than going with their current insurance carrier.
    </p><p>In implied consent suspensions, there is a mandatory waiting period before the hardship license will be issued. During the waiting period the client should make arrangements for the SR-22 insurance and make sure the insurance carrier advises DMV that it is effective at least a week before she is eligible for the hardship permit. Provide the client with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Forms/DMV/6044fill.pdf">Hardship Permit form</a>, and have them fill it out completely. DMV is very particular about routes to/from employment. The client must list every street on which she drives and the direction in which she travels. If the client travels extensively, provide information for going to and from the office and, on a separate sheet of paper, list the counties where work-related travel is required. Don’t forget to include a county the client must go through in order to reach a business location in another county. If information on alcohol and diversion programs or AA meetings is not available at the time the request is submitted, it can be supplied to the DMV at a later date. Again, be sure to list very specific travel routes and times. A check must be provided.

    <p>One of the things clients dislike most about getting a DUII is the requirement for an IID. It is embarrassing and a hassle. For information about the dangers of using an IID see “<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/business/drunk-driving-interlock-crash.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The Unforeseen Dangers of a Device That Curbs Drunken Driving</a>,” from the December 23, 2019, edition of the <i>New York Times</i>.
    </p><p>ORS 813.602 governs when an IID is required. An IID is required during the term of any hardship permit. For a first-time DUII conviction, an IID will be required for one full year after the ending date of the suspension. For a second or subsequent DUII conviction, an IID will be required for two full years after the end of any suspension or revocation period.
    </p><p>For diversion, an IID is required on 0.08% or greater alcohol cases and cases where there is any amount of alcohol and a controlled substance. If the client enters diversion on an alcohol-only DUII with a breath test of less than 0.08 (hopefully the attorney has pushed for a dismissal in the case and carefully considered going to trial), or on a controlled substance case without any alcohol, then installation of an IID is at the discretion of the court. Always request a waiver of the IID in that situation. ORS 813.645 allows people to remove the IID after six months as long as there are all clean blows and the person is in compliance with treatment. Most people will want to do that. There is a sample form provided in the DUII Diversion Forms in Chapter 6, Appendix A.
    </p><p>Be aware that ORS 813.635(2) provides a separate requirement for 90 days of no negative IID reports to be sent to DMV so a person can not wait out the one year diversion period and then drive without using an IID. Regardless of how long it has been after diversion, a person will be required to use the IID for a minimum of 90 days. Strategically, the client may want to wait until after the end of diversion to get the IID so there is no risk to losing diversion. Or, a person may want to just get the IID for the last 90 days of the diversion. Or, a person may consider installing the IID during a term of suspension and starting the car without driving it at least once a month to fulfill the IID requirement. This area of law is changing all the time so make sure you understand current IID requirements so you can advise your client properly.
    </p><p>For instance, effective January 1, 2020, HB 3005 amends ORS 813.599 to change what constitutes a “test violation” of an ignition interlock device. For a person on DUII diversion, an attempt to start a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of 0.02 percent rather than 0.00% is now a violation unless the person performs a subsequent test within ten minutes that registers a BAC of less than 0.02% (previously 0.00%). This bill also increases the allowable rolling retest BAC for a person on DUII diversion from 0.00% to 0.02%. For a person required to use an IID but not in the DUII diversion program, the bill reduces the allowable BAC to start a vehicle from 0.04% to 0.02%.
    </p><p>Note that the DMV has created an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Forms/DMV/6874.pdf">exemption for individuals operating employer owned vehicles</a>.

    <p>One of the complaints heard most often from clients is the inability to reach the attorney or find out information on things they want to know. The assistant can often eliminate this complaint by being a source between the client and the unavailable attorney. It is important to not give legal advice in the process.
    </p><p>The assistant can keep the client advised of what is happening by diligently sending copies of every document sent or received.
    </p><p>The assistant can monitor appointments by getting the client and witnesses scheduled for pretrial preparation, making sure the client is aware of and will be present for all mandatory appearances. Calling the client the day before a hearing as a reminder is always helpful and appreciated.
    </p><p>When the client is unable to reach the attorney, the assistant can determine what the client needs to know, speak with the attorney and return the call. Often, the assistant will know the information and can answer the question. During times when the attorney is unavailable, this can save tempers and time. All this is easier if the attorney introduces the client to the assistant during the initial interview and tells the client that he can talk with the assistant and that often the assistant will be easier to reach than the attorney. How the attorney presents this to the client will determine the client’s acceptance.

    <p>Stay calm. Your client made a mistake and a bad judgment call that will affect his life, family status, and often employment status. More than likely, he has never been through this process and will need a little extra attention. The client is not concerned about your caseload or the attorney’s trial schedule. The only thing the client is worried about is his case. Do not try to minimize this worry. It is real and you need to treat it that way. Your client may come across as irritated and sometimes obnoxious. Do not take it personally. Remain calm and professional at all times. If the client gets out of hand, simply let her know that you will pass information to the attorney and have that attorney call them back. That will sometimes suffice in getting them off the phone for a “time out” or cool down period. If client becomes verbally abusive, simply tell her you would be happy to help and to call back when she is ready to discuss the matter more civilly. If all attempts of calming the client down fail, you may hang up on them. More often than not, this will get their attention and they will call back to apologize and be more apt to work with you. It is important to not demean the client at this point. This is an opportunity to build a working relationship once again with your client. Respect goes both ways. See Chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of interacting with clients in a healthy and positive way.

    <p>You can make your job a lot easier by establishing good working relationships with all staff in the courts where your employer has cases. Learning their rules and procedures and following them will make things run smoothly. Having someone in the courthouse, DMV or whatever agencies you deal with who will go that extra distance to assist you with problems, help you locate information or work around a problem will be priceless. Don’t forget the people who do you favors. A thank you every time is a must! We all like to know we’re appreciated.
    </p><p><i>Bill Uhle, (ed. 2004):</i> I can’t emphasize enough how valuable an intelligent, knowledgeable and well-trained assistant can be in taking these cases, from setting up the initial appointment until the attorney and client leave the office for the courthouse on the morning of trial. Delegate as much of the non-courtroom work (subpoenas, organizing witness interviews, docketing, resets, dealing with DMV, forms, and the myriad of other things covered in this chapter) to your assistant. These activities take up a lot of time and energy. If they can be delegated to a competent assistant, you will have far more time to concentrate on preparing your motions, your theory of defense and your witnesses for trial.
    </p><p>Note: Bill Uhle retired in the years since editing the 204 edition, but he had the same assistant for more than 30 years. He said she knew more about “her end” of their business than anyone he knew. He said that if you plan on doing these cases in volume over a number of years, a competent assistant is essential and will delay the inevitable defense attorney burnout.
