        <p>This chapter is dedicated to the late John “JP” Powers, who passed away from Acute Myeloid Leukemia in early
            2017. He joined the Oregon State Bar in September of 1974 as one of the youngest individuals ever admitted
            to the practice of law in Oregon, and owned his own law practice in Portland specializing in DUII defense.
            According to his <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://www.never-gone.com/memorials/johnpowers">obituary</a>, JP looked for ways to help his
            clients “find serenity in their lives in a much broader sense, including through introduction to AA. He
            often quietly extended his generosity without any expectation of recognition, fanfare, or payment. JP’s
            kindness extended in every direction to those fortunate enough to meet him.”<sup id="cite_ref-1"

        <p>John Powers, who authored the original version of this chapter some years ago, noted that more people are
            arrested for DUII than any other crime. He speculated that everyone who practices criminal law eventually
            represents someone accused of it. A number of remarkable <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="https://www.bactrack.com/blogs/expert-center/35040645-DUII-statistics">statistics</a> regarding
            the prevalence of drunk driving support his conjecture.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Approximately 1.5 million people are arrested every year for driving under the influence of
                        alcohol and/or drugs. That means every year one out of every 121 licensed drivers is arrested
                        for DUII.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>On average, a person convicted of DUII has driven over the legal limit 80 times before his or her
                        first arrest. The obvious implication of this statistic is that huge numbers of people have
                        driven under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at some point in their lives and made it home
                        safely and without being arrested.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>About one in three Americans will be involved in a DUII-related crash during their lifetimes.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>DUII cases cut across all social classes and, as anyone who has conducted a voir dire in a DUII trial can
            attest, drunk or otherwise impaired driving touches virtually everyone’s life. The optimist will interpret
            these statistics as a reason to expand their DUII practice—look at all the potential clients! But what is
            the best way to approach this population?
        </p>
        <p>The Powers Principles go a long way toward answering this question and reflect our own aspirations of how we
            want to be treating our clients—like fellow human beings worthy of compassion and kindness. In section II,
            we review the 10 Powers Principles. In section III, we share some additional practical tips for developing a
            more person-centered practice. In section IV, we reprint Jennifer Gerstenzang’s useful article, recently
            published in <i>The Champion</i>, about counseling addicted clients. A person’s arrest on DUII charges could
            very well be their “rock bottom” in the journey to overcoming addiction, and our interaction with him or her
            a rare opportunity to guide them toward sobriety. As attorneys, we have an ethical obligation to learn the
            relevant skills in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>Section V is about concentration, presence and awareness. Whether we realize it or not, exposure to the
            constant barrage of people’s problems and the highly adversarial nature of litigation can really wear us
            down. It’s no secret that criminal defense attorneys suffer disproportionately from anxiety, depression and
            the same alcohol and substance abuse issues that plague our DUII clients. Mindfulness and meditation may not
            be the whole answer, but they have been shown to be helpful to many attorneys and clients. As an added
            bonus, increasing presence through mind-training practices can help improve our performance in court, and
            can help keep our clients calm during stressful proceedings.

        <p>You know what to do, but does your staff? Since you probably will not be involved in the initial call, your
            staff must know what information is essential to gather. Have a sample “cheat sheet” (see Chapter 3 for
            helpful checklists) that will suffice until your staff is familiar with the various issues and deadlines.
            However, the mere gathering of information will be of no use unless your staff knows how to apply the rules.
        </p>
        <p>The most important area of concern is the correct arrest date so that an In-Person DMV Hearing can be
            requested by 5:00 p.m. on the tenth day following the arrest. For example, it’s 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday,
            February 18, the day after President’s Day. A prospective client calls and informs your receptionist that
            they were arrested on Wednesday, February 5. “Sorry, you’re too late to request a DMV hearing.” Wrong! Since
            the tenth day fell on a weekend and Monday was a holiday, the tenth day would be the 18th. This means your
            staff needs to get a request in by 5:00 p.m.
        </p>
        <p>In many cases, you will be retained before your client’s arraignment. If the case is a misdemeanor, a waiver
            of appearance is allowed by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors135.html">ORS 135.030</a>. If the case is a
            felony then your client must appear in person. In many cases, clients will be arrested but not booked at the
            jail. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors813.html">ORS 813.017</a> requires the court
            to ensure the person is booked after being charged with DUII—“When a person is arraigned on a charge of
            driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010, a court shall ensure that the
            defendant submits to booking, if the person has not already been booked on that charge. [2015 c.145 §2].” If
            your client was not booked when they were arrested, make sure they know they will have to have their
            fingerprints taken in the jurisdiction of their arrest. Depending on the jurisdiction a photograph (mugshot)
            may be taken as well, which will likely be posted online. This is one of the greatest collateral
            consequences of DUII for many people. See Chapter 3 for more information on arraignments and mugshot
            removal.
        </p>
        <p>Likewise, you should prepare your clients for the possibility that they will not be arraigned on the
            originally scheduled date, and that this does not necessarily mean their case is getting dismissed.<br>
            This often happens on a DRE DUII if the prosecutor wants to wait for toxicology before making a filing
            decision. If this happens, remember to get their citation stamped to prove they appeared in case the
            prosecutor attempts to file charges past the statute of limitations date. We also suggest that you send a
            letter to the prosecutor so that your client can arrange a voluntary appearance if and when charges are
            filed.

        <p>A great number of DUII clients are alcoholics. Alcoholism is a chronic, progressive disease with three

        <p>Powers is of course correct in noting that we are lawyers and not doctors. But judges do call us counselors.
        </p>
        <p>“Thank you, counselor, I have your argument.”
        </p>
        <p>Because of the casual way this word is used in our profession, the deeper meaning can sometimes fail to
            register. But according to our licenses, and consistent with the reality of our collective experience, we
            are all counselors at law—“counselors” first and “at law” second.
        </p>
        <p>What does it mean to be a counselor? It means our clients hire us to reduce their suffering. They want us to
            be “real” with them, to inject humanity into an inhuman process, to put ourselves in their shoes, view the
            issues through their eyes, and reduce their pain by focusing on their needs, desires, and values. Even the
            most cursory look at online client reviews teaches us that clients judge us based on how we make them feel,
            not necessarily on the quality of our legal representation. Relating to our clients in a way that reduces
            their suffering is a prerequisite for doing a truly excellent job.
        </p>
        <p>The Powers Principles immediately ring true because each one is aimed at reducing client suffering—by
            explaining what is going on and what clients can expect in the future, by making sure they do not feel taken
            advantage of financially, and by showing interest in their concerns and perspectives. In legal theory, this
            type of counseling-inspired, client-centered approach was first advocated by Binder and Price in the late
            1970s and has become standard among frontline legal defenders.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Client-centered advocacy traces back to Carl Rogers (1902–1987), the most influential proponent of
            person-centered <i>psychological</i> counseling. He explained the “central hypothesis” of his approach as
            follows: “Individuals have within themselves vast resources for self-understanding and for altering their
            self-concept, attitudes, and self-directed behavior – [but] these resources can be tapped only if a
            definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.”<sup id="cite_ref-4"
                class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Rogers identified three conditions for creating that climate in therapy, and they apply with equal force to
            person-centered legal representation.
        </p>
        <p>First, Rogers extolled a counselor’s Realness or “genuineness,” explaining that the more a counselor is him
            or herself in the relationship, putting up no professional front or façade, the better the working
            relationship is likely to be.
        </p>
        <p>Second, he encouraged Empathy—which he defined as actively listening with true interest and, thereby,
            accurately understanding a client’s feelings and personal meaning. In the world of criminal defense,
            clients’ feelings often revolve around the pain of lost control. Clients frequently hire us to restore a
            sense of <i>perceived</i> control, which has been shown to correlate with physical health and subjective
            feelings of well-being. This is why things like letters of engagement and other signs of professionalism and
            respect, careful explanations of criminal and administrative procedures, detailed discussions of the
            evidence and the like can be so important and valuable to clients, even though it may feel (to us) like
            these activities do not contribute directly toward a favorable resolution or victory at trial.
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps most relevant to attorneys is Rogers’ third condition for creating the right climate—an attitude of
            Unconditional Positive Regard. He described it as follows:
        </p>
        <p>To the extent that the counselor finds himself or herself experiencing warm acceptance of each aspect of the
            clients experience as being part of that client, he or she is experiencing unconditional positive regard.…
            This means there are no conditions of acceptance, no feeling of “I only like you if you are thus and so.” It
            means “prizing” of the person.… It is at the opposite pole from a selective evaluating attitude – “You are
            bad in these ways, good in those.” It involves as much feeling of acceptance for the client’s expression of
            negative, “bad”…defensive, abnormal feelings as for his expression of “good” [ones]…
        </p>
        <p>Rogers gave some examples of thoughts that are characteristic of unconditional positive regard; his list
            serves as a useful tool for assessing one’s own attitude:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I feel no revulsion at anything the client says.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I feel neither approval nor disapproval of the client and his statements – simply acceptance.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I feel warmly toward the client, toward his weaknesses and problems as well as his
                        potentialities.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I am not inclined to pass judgment on what the client tells me.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I like my client.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Developing unconditional positive regard even toward difficult clients is a matter of intentionality. Some
            practitioners choose to reframe difficult situations, such as that of somebody facing a fifth or sixth DUII,
            viewing the broader context of where a person is coming from. Others approach the issue from philosophical
            or religious perspectives. There is no one right approach.
        </p>
        <p>In our desire to genuinely connect with clients, some of us fail to develop appropriate professional
            boundaries. These signs of unhealthy boundaries may be helpful for purposes of a self-check:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Excessive self-disclosure to client.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Feeling “overwhelmed” by client.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Allowing a client to dictate the direction of the case.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Going against personal values to “help” client.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>Practice Tip
        </pre>
        <p>Need to create better boundaries? Here are some tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Proper boundaries begin at home.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider physically putting away your devices and going completely offline during regularly scheduled hours,
            such as evenings, early mornings, or one weekend day a week.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Create structure.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, let’s say your client has a habit of calling at all hours to discuss their feelings about the
            case. Clearly scheduled weekly check-ins can eliminate this problem.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Lay out your limits very clearly.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, tell your clients verbally (or, better yet, in writing) the hours you will be available for
            work-related conversations, what constitutes an emergency, and what they should do in an emergency. Explain
            your boundaries in concrete terms and relate them to your clients’ interests. For example, you can say: “I
            may not be able to get back to you this week because I am working on another case. But please rest assured
            that when the time comes for me to focus on <i>your</i> case, it, too, will have my undivided attention.”
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Plan in advance for things to go wrong.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s helpful to visualize your boundaries getting crossed, and how you’re going to handle those situations
            beforehand so you have a plan of action. This way, when a difficult situation comes up, you won’t be
            hijacked by your emotions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Bring up problems right away.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When boundaries are violated, it’s not uncommon for people to get upset and ruminate endlessly. Instead, plan
            to speak up immediately.
        </p>
        <p>To sum up, there is no magic formula for striking the right balance of realness, empathy, unconditional
            positive regard and appropriate professional boundaries. But having an awareness of what an excellent
            attorney-client relationship ought to look like and what aspects of the relationship we ought to be paying
            attention to can help us all advance toward that goal.

        <p>Defense attorneys hold the knowledge and skill to help clients navigate the criminal justice system. For many
            clients, this is the first time they have ever been in trouble with the law, and it is a haunting and
            traumatic experience. They cling to counsel’s words and advice in the belief that the lawyer holds the
            secret to their fate. Because their freedom is at stake, they are highly motivated to achieve sobriety with
            a commitment and focus not previously possessed.
        </p>
        <p>For this reason, a client is willing to heed counsel’s advice and direction, even if the client has
            faithfully ignored this same advice for years. As such, attorneys have a duty to make sure the advice they
            offer is sound and is tailored to the client’s specific needs. In order to do that, attorneys must stay
            informed and up to date on the new and changing research and treatments for addiction. In this way, they can
            best serve their clients as they embark on their journey toward sobriety.
        </p>
        <p>Attorneys who limit their practice solely to representing the client on the criminal charges are missing an
            opportunity to develop a deeper lawyer-client relationship and to help their client avoid future issues with
            the law and in the client’s personal life. The ABA Model Rules are not explicit when it comes to handling a
            client with an addiction, but they provide guidance. Notable model rules include Rule 1.1, discussing
            attorney competence<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> when
            representing a client; Rule 1.14, discussing representing a client with diminished capacity;<sup
                id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> and Rule 1.6, discussing duties
            of confidentiality to the client.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Diminished capacity is defined as “an unbalanced mental state that is considered to make a person less
            answerable for a crime and is recognized as grounds to reduce the charge.”<sup id="cite_ref-8"
                class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> In cases with a client who is struggling with an
            addiction, quite often this information can be a source of mitigation when negotiating the case and
            humanizing the client to the court and opposing counsel. Rule 1.14 allows lawyers to consult with
            individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect clients when clients are unable to
            adequately act in their own best interests. Understanding the different treatments that are available and
            knowing who to consult is an important aspect of representing the client to the best of the lawyer’s
            ability.

            <i>why</i> the client began using drugs or alcohol in the first place. Sometimes clients are too close to
            their addiction to see things as clearly as their loved ones. All this information can be used to develop a
            promising strategy to address the client’s needs while the attorney is fighting the client’s criminal case.
            Of course, the lawyer must make sure she speaks with the client before talking to the family to avoid
            breaching confidentiality.

        <p>An attorney’s genius in the courtroom will likely be appreciated much more by opposing counsel and the bench
            rather than the attorney’s client. Clients will not remember the attorney’s strategy, cross-examination, or
            impassioned argument nearly as much as they will remember the way she made them <i>feel</i>. The
            conversations the lawyer has with the client about the client’s struggle with alcohol or drugs, what this
            struggle has cost him, and how he can try to find relief will show the client that counsel cares about who
            he is and the quality of his life after the case resolves. Colleagues will refer clients to an attorney
            based on counsel’s legal prowess. Clients will refer their friends based on the excellence of counsel’s
            emotional first aid.
        </p>
        <p>These conversations should start as soon as possible in the attorney-client relationship. They are powerful
            trust-builders and will set the tone for the rest of the relationship. The information gleaned from these
            conversations will help the lawyer understand the client better and make the lawyer a far better advocate on
            behalf of the client during negotiations or, if necessary, at any sentencing hearing. Finally, having this
            conversation early can help counsel get her client into treatment at the earliest possible date. Clients can
            be saved from custody time or a bail increase based upon their placement in a treatment facility. Early
            identification of a problem allows attorney and client time to find the right treatment option and gives the

        <p>New and exciting treatments exist that go beyond the familiar AA/NA 12-step approach. Luckily, in recent
            years there has been a general shift in the way people think and talk about addiction. “The surgeon
            general’s report reaffirms what the scientific establishment has been saying for years: <i>addiction is a
                disease, not a moral failing</i>. It is characterized not necessarily by physical dependence or
            withdrawal but by compulsive repetition of an activity despite life- damaging consequences.”<sup
                id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The same report found that 21
            million Americans have a drug or alcohol addiction, which makes the disorder more common than cancer.<sup
                id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> With this information,
            motivated scientists and researchers are examining what is actually happening in the addicted brain.
        </p>
        <p>At this point in time, two schools of thought predominate regarding the causes of and best treatment
            practices for addiction:
        </p>
        <p><b>1. Addiction is caused by faulty chemistry or bad wiring of the brain. Treatment should include certain
                medications or brain stimulation while simultaneously providing psycho-social support; or</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>2. Addiction treatment requires intensive psychological work that can be assisted through the use of
                medication to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms.</b>

        <p>As with every worthy goal in life, there is no silver bullet or quick solution when it comes to recovery. The
            options listed below can seldom be used on their own. More likely the client will require a combination of

        <p>Opioid receptors in the brain’s reward center are responsible for the euphoric effects individuals feel when
            they use opioids such as heroin and oxycodone and when they drink alcohol. “A receptor is like a button or a
            lock on the surface of a cell — when ‘pushed’ or ‘unlocked’ by another chemical, a reaction occurs, and a
            cascade of effects is set into motion.”<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> When these opioid receptors are stimulated, the user feels a
            rush of pleasurable and rewarding feelings.
        </p>
        <p>Naltrexone is a mu-opioid receptor blocker, also known as an opioid antagonist. Thus, an individual who takes
            naltrexone will not get the pleasurable effects of opioids or alcohol. Imagine placing a small yet strong
            cap on the opioid receptors in the brain, thereby locking the door to the receptor closed. Because the
            receptor is unable to be stimulated, no chemical reaction can occur, and thus there is no release of the
            euphoric effects of the drug or alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>This effectively eliminates the temptation to use. This is because if an individual does take opioids or
            drink alcohol while taking naltrexone, they will be unable to feel the “high” from the drugs. People
            struggling with alcohol addiction may not stop drinking entirely while on naltrexone, but binge-drinking is
            dramatically reduced. When they do not find the relief they are accustomed to in their first or second
            drink, they stop drinking.
        </p>
        <p>Individuals can be so afraid of the pain of withdrawal that just one relapse can terminate their recovery
            efforts. If the individual is taking naltrexone and relapses, not only will he not get the pleasure from
            taking the drug, but he also will avoid the pain of withdrawal. Since the client’s brain has not processed
            the drug or alcohol and experienced the euphoric effect, the brain is not missing the drug or alcohol when
            it is once again absent from the body.
        </p>
        <p>“Of great importance, persons treated with naltrexone are less likely to report alcohol and opioid cravings
            and the repeated thoughts and obsessions with drug use when they are not using.”<sup id="cite_ref-13"
                class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Anecdotally, there have also been reports that
            naltrexone has helped individuals struggling with other disorders, such as gambling, smoking, and
            obsessive-compulsive disorders. Additionally, “persons maintained on naltrexone have a very low risk of
            continued illegal opioid use and are less likely to drink alcohol heavily compared to placebo.”<sup
                id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Naltrexone takes the edge off the addiction cravings while individuals are trying to pick up the other pieces
            of their lives. It can be very helpful for individuals who are being released from jail or prison to assist
            them in maintaining their sobriety while they adjust to freedom. In many cases, it is an extraordinary and
            effective tool, and is being adopted by many drug courts throughout the country, with promising results. In
            drug courts, it is used in conjunction with the other treatments and programs to help the participants
            succeed in reaching their goals.
        </p>
        <p>Naltrexone is an alternative to other medications, like Suboxone and methadone, that are commonly used to
            treat opioid addiction. Recall that naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, while Suboxone and methadone are
            opioid agonists, which means they are substances that initiate a physiological response when combined with a
            receptor. Methadone is a full opioid agonist while Suboxone is a partial opioid agonist. This means that
            Suboxone and methadone attach themselves to opioid receptors but, instead of blocking the receptors, they
            stimulate the receptors. This helps individuals working on their sobriety to manage or avoid the pain from
            withdrawal by essentially weaning off drugs or alcohol. It can also be helpful because these drugs are
            supposed to be less addictive than the drug they are trying to kick.
        </p>
        <p>However, methadone and Suboxone are still opioids, and thus can be addictive in themselves. For an individual
            who has gone through withdrawal and is clean, naltrexone is a beneficial option because it is not addictive.
        </p>
        <p>Naltrexone, which must be prescribed by a doctor, can be administered in two ways. It can either be taken in
            pill form orally on a once-daily basis or it can be injected into the buttocks once every four weeks. The
            first option is economical and is more likely to be covered by insurance. The latter is ideal because the
            client only has to choose his sobriety once a month rather than make that choice every day. The injection,
            however, can be very expensive and may not be covered by insurance.
        </p>
        <p>It is important that clients be prepared to receive the treatment before having either the pill or injection
            administered. Being prepared is important because the medication will block the opioid receptors in the
            brain, which can be a very good thing if they are trying to maintain their sobriety, and can be a very
            painful decision in some cases. Patients must stop taking any opioids for at least 7 to 14 days before
            starting naltrexone. If they use within that time frame, taking naltrexone can trigger sudden opioid
            withdrawal, which is not only painful but also can be dangerous. If the person who is on naltrexone gets
            injured, they will not be able to manage their pain with typical prescription pain relievers. As the
            receptors for these drugs are blocked, they will not receive the intended relief. In emergencies, doctors
            still have some options available to treat pain that will not be blocked by the receptors, but these should
            be reserved for serious situations.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, when using naltrexone clients should be cautioned about the dangers of overdose if and when
            they end their treatment. When individuals who have a history of long-term opioid use relapse, they may
            return to their typical dosage without accounting for the impact their sobriety had on their tolerance. This
            can lead to devastating, and sometimes fatal, overdoses.
        </p>
        <p>A final caution is to make sure the client is simultaneously being treated for any emotional or psychological
            concerns when taking this medication. If the client is using substances as a form of self-medication, taking
            away the relief without responsibly managing the underlying pain or trauma may lead to the client simply
            replacing one substance with another. Naltrexone does not block the receptors for amphetamines, only
            opioids, and unfortunately it does not block the chemical reaction in the brain if the client uses fentanyl.
            This additional support may help the client avoid a panicked and desperate need for an escape, and the
            client will be building the tools to maintain long-term sobriety.

    <div class="editableSection mw-collapsible mw-made-collapsible" id="mw-customcollapsible-21">
        <p>As understanding of the addicted brain expands, so do the creativity of the treatments offered. Psychiatrists
            and neuroscientists have observed that addiction weakens the brain’s executive control center, the
            prefrontal cortex. For example, in a study done by Ritz Z. Goldstein, highlighted in <i>National
                Geographic</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> she
            revealed that cocaine addicts have reduced gray matter volume in their prefrontal cortex. This means that
            addicted individuals have poorer executive function and generally perform worse in psychological tests of
            memory, attention, and decision- making. Unfortunately, her study does not determine whether addiction
            causes these impairments in the brain or if the impairments made the brain more vulnerable to addiction.
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Luigi Gallimberti, a psychiatrist and toxicologist who has treated addiction for 30 years, was inspired
            by studies conducted by neurologist Antonello Bonci and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Bonci found
            that the region in the brain responsible for inhibiting behavior in cocaine- addicted rats was abnormally
            quiet. When he activated these cells in the rats, their “interest in cocaine basically vanished.”<sup
                id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Gallimberti used this research
            to try Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) on people struggling with cocaine addiction.
        </p>
        <p>TMS involves the application of electromagnetic pulses to the prefrontal cortex to activate those neurons.
            This form of brain stimulation has been used to treat depression and migraines. Scientists run electrical
            current through a coiled wire inside a wand, and the wand creates a magnetic pulse that alters electrical
            activity in the brain. Gallimberti hypothesized that repeated pulses may activate drug-damaged neural
            pathways much like a reboot on a frozen computer.
        </p>
        <p>Working together alongside Gallimberti’s partner, neurocognitive psychologist Alberto Terraneo, the
            researchers tested their theory on 29 people addicted to cocaine. Sixteen people received TMS, while 13
            received standard care, but not TMS. By the end of the trial, 11 people were drug-free in the TMS group,
            while only three were drug-free in the standard care group.
        </p>
        <p>The research continues in this area but the initial results are promising. There are other ways that
            individuals can strengthen their prefrontal cortex without sending electrical currents into the brain,
            including mindfulness training and meditation, but these practices require discipline and dedication, which
            may be difficult during the time someone is struggling with addiction. Other research, listed below, looks
            at restoring the damaged or weakened brain more generally.

        <p>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) therapy is another addiction treatment that focuses on strengthening
            the brain. NAD is a coenzyme of niacin and is a building block in the body that the brain, internal organs,
            and neurological systems rely on to function well. As people age, their NAD levels decline. Addiction,
            depression, stress, and illness accelerate the depletion of NAD levels as well.
        </p>
        <p>NAD therapy works to restore these depleted enzymes and thus boost the function of the brain. When used for
            addiction therapy, though it is often also used to treat depression, anxiety and other ailments as well, the
            treatment lasts about 10 days. Each day the patient receives an intravenous infusion of the enzyme for about
            6 to 8 hours.
        </p>
        <p>NAD therapy is often combined with other tools and medications mentioned in this article to increase the
            effectiveness of the treatment. When NAD therapy is used to help people during their initial detoxification,
            practitioners often use the BRIDGE to manage the patients discomfort during withdrawal.

        <p>As mentioned previously, the pain of detoxification, or even merely the fear of that pain, can keep an
            individual from seeking treatment and sobriety. The BRIDGE is a fascinating device that helps individuals
            manage their pain — either pain from withdrawal or other acute pain — through neuro-stimulation. The BRIDGE
            sits on a patient’s ear, is minimally invasive, and is an auricular peripheral nerve field stimulator that
            connects topically to the patient’s ear, blocking pain signals from getting to the brain.
        </p>
        <p>The benefit to this treatment, as opposed to medication assisted treatment such as Naltrexone, Methadone or
            Suboxone, is that the client does not need to complete his detox before using the BRIDGE. Additionally, this
            treatment works very quickly, with patients reporting pain reduction in as little as 20 to 30 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>In practice, an individual using this device for pain reduction associated with withdrawal would wear the
            BRIDGE for the initial four to five days of detoxification, when the pain is the most acute and the most
            unbearable. Then the device would be safely removed. These types of treatments are effective at convincing
            individuals they will be able to handle the process of withdrawal.

        <p>Popularized by misleading and objectively bad television, interventionists are on the rise. When conducted by
            trained, educated and licensed professionals, interventions can be incredibly effective. A good
            interventionist will work with the family first, before talking to the loved one with the addiction. The
            interventionist can identify any dysfunction in the family dynamics and can prepare the family for what to
            expect and what their roles will be in their loved one’s recovery.
        </p>
        <p>Often, an individual struggling with an addiction may be in a relationship with someone who, in some ways,
            triggers or supports the addicted behavior. In some relationships, a spouse or significant other
            subconsciously relies on their loved one’s addiction, and may feel as if they are losing control if their
            loved one seeks treatment. A great intervention program will also work closely with the enabling spouse to
            convince him or her to participate in the intervention and play a supportive role to get the loved one into
            treatment.
        </p>
        <p>If the client’s family is considering an intervention, it is worth it to vet the program to see how involved
            people at the program are and how much time they spend with the family in advance of the actual
            intervention. The client will appreciate the fact that the attorney helped him and his family spend their
            money wisely.

        <p>Remember, any recommendation an attorney makes to a client will reflect upon the attorney. Counsel would not
            refer a prior client to another attorney she did not know or trust, and thus she should be sure she does her
            research when suggesting a treatment center. She has already invested a lot of time in the client’s
            sobriety, and therefore she should make sure she is recommending a quality placement.
        </p>
        <p>In recent years and in reaction to the explosion of the opioid epidemic, the United States has seen a huge
            growth in addiction treatment centers. New inpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization, intensive
            outpatient, and sober living facilities are rapidly popping up throughout the country. With insurance
            footing the bill for many of these centers, there is a great deal of money to be made in these facilities,
            and regulation is surprisingly relaxed. In Malibu, California, for example, where the population is only
            13,000, there are 47 licensed rehabilitation centers. In Southern California, there are 1,117 licensed
            rehabilitation centers, and this does not include unlicensed sober living homes.<sup id="cite_ref-17"
                class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>As with all professions, there may be some “bad apples.” With so much variety, and with the potential for
            centers to make a lot of money very quickly, some programs undoubtedly are cutting corners. Additionally,
            many people who start programs are in recovery themselves. This can be both a blessing and a curse. Some
            programs have had to shut down because of their founders relapsing in their recovery, while other programs
            thrive by being run by someone with an intimate understanding of recovery.
        </p>
        <p>Reach out to the treatment and rehabilitation community to make a few connections. Sit down with people who
            are familiar with the local programs and their reputations. Counsel should find people whose opinions she
            trusts and learn what programs they endorse. Then contact those programs. Take a tour of their facilities.
            Keep a list and try to match the client’s insurance with the right program. Additionally, make sure that
            licensed practitioners are working with the clients on a daily basis, as some programs will hire student
            practitioners to do the day-to-day work.

    <div class="editableSection mw-collapsible mw-made-collapsible" id="mw-customcollapsible-26">
        <p>One person’s success in recovery does not mean that he or she has uncovered a secret formula for sobriety
            that can translate to another person’s success. In the same way that there are many unique paths to
            addiction, there are many twisting trails in the journey to sobriety. No two paths are exactly alike. Take
            the lessons from the success stories of clients as anecdotal evidence to pass on to future clients. These
            stories can be motivating and inspiring, and can give clients a realistic picture of recovery. Be careful,
            however, not to overly rely on one treatment model.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, it is important that counsel take an active role in the client’s recovery. Check in with the client
            as regularly as possible to see how the treatment is going. Remember, an attorney has a unique position of
            authority that can motivate the client to keep pushing himself and will remind him what is at stake. If the
            client is not happy or successful with whatever treatment he is pursuing, it may be because it is not a good
            fit for him. Let the client know that he has an option of leaving or changing treatment, but that to do so,
            it is best, and in some cases mandatory, that he finds a new treatment option before abandoning the current
            treatment model.
        </p>
        <p>Talk to the staff at the program the client is attending to track his progress. The client’s account of his
            improvement may be quite different from the program’s update — for better or for worse. Keep the client
            accountable and make sure he is taking an active role in his recovery.
        </p>
        <p>Most DUII attorneys, and criminal defense attorneys in general, work hard because they care about their
            clients. Clients look to counsel to guide them through the darkest period of their lives. Ultimately,
            clients are responsible for their own success in rehabilitation, but their lawyers play an important role
            steering them in the right direction and on the right path. The coming years bring extraordinary strides in
            science and neurology that will only continue to help clients achieve sobriety and success. Learning about
            new treatments is as important as reading new case law. Doing so provides an invaluable service and assists
            in obtaining the best possible result for clients.

        <p>It is worth noting that some clients are going to be very resistant to formal substance abuse treatment but
            may be interested in and/or open to other approaches toward achieving sobriety.
        </p>
        <p>Alcoholics Anonymous and related 12-step programs are informal, hugely popular higher power–based support
            groups that have helped countless people. In the Eugene area alone, there are multiple 12-step meetings
            every day—morning, noon and night—which can be found at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://www.eviaa.org">www.eviaa.org</a>. Clients should be able to get a home group, a sponsor,
            and service position without too much trouble. In terms of mitigation, this is an anonymous program so it
            may be difficult to get a letter of attendance; but if your client does have a sponsor, that person may be
            willing to write a letter or appear at a sentencing hearing. You don’t want to offend people by suggesting
            AA, but if they seem like they would benefit, it may be worth a mention.
        </p>
        <p>Other clients may be open to private medical treatment with a psychiatrist and/or therapist. You will want to
            have your client sign a release of information and have a letter sent to your office. Each doctor is
            different and may have an approach that resonates.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, there is bibliotherapy. Clients who may not be ready for more aggressive types of treatment are
            often willing to pick up a book. There are titles to appeal to every possible angle: from <i>Quit Like a
                Woman</i> by Holly Whitaker and <i>The Craving Mind</i> by Judson Brewer to books about new programs
            being developed that use psychedelic drugs to treat drug and alcohol addiction, for example at the Johns
            Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"

        <p>As Thich Nhat Hanh said: <i>“The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness
                embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.”</i><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Henry David Thoreau also acknowledges the important of presence:
            “<i>You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment. Fools
                stand on their island of opportunities and look toward another land. There is no other land; there is no
                other life but this.”</i><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
            By being more present, more open, and less reactive, we can reduce our own suffering as well as the
            suffering of those around us, such as our clients, coworkers and families.
        </p>
        <p>Meditation and mindfulness practices aimed at achieving this sort of presence are used by many religions, but
            there is nothing fundamentally religious about these practices and they cross boundaries between religious
            and secular life. They are popular because they are simple and accessible to everyone. By paying very close
            attention to the present moment we can develop clarity and penetrative insight. But how do we get there?
        </p>
        <p>In his useful 2018 book, <i>Aware: The Science and Practice of Presence</i>, Dr. Dan Siegel describes a
            method of cultivating presence by developing three pillars of mind training: focused attention, open
            awareness and kind intention.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
            Dr. Siegel has also developed the “Wheel of Awareness” meditation practice, included in Appendix A.
        </p>
        <p>Focused attention is something that attorneys spend a great deal of time doing. As stated in the December
            2019 issue of the Oregon State Bar <i>Bulletin,</i> “[Legal work] requires sustained focus, marathon-caliber
            mental endurance. It requires <i>attention</i>, the very currency of the billable hour.”<sup
                id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Focused attention is what
            drives energy and information into awareness. How can we improve and hone our attention?
        </p>
        <p>Focused attention meditation, or concentration meditation, is a meditation practice in which we focus on
            something such as the breath and when our mind is inevitably distracted we bring it back again and again.
            This is akin to a mental workout: the loss of attention is like the relaxing of our attention, and bringing
            attention back to our object of meditation is like flexing the muscle of attention. Over time you may find
            that your ability to concentrate and have longer periods of undistracted attention will improve.
        </p>
        <p>The object of focus could be internal or external, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Mantra – repeating a word, phrase, or sound over and over.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Visualization – picturing a place or focusing on a goal.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A body part – focusing on a particular area or sensation in the body.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Candle – looking at a flame to focus the mind.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Mala beads – counting beads on a mala.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Sound – listening to a gong or chime.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this type of meditation, the goal is to keep the attention focused and nothing else. So if you were to
            stare at a candle, or repeat a mantra, you would just engage the mind in that practice. The more you
            practice, the better you will become at zoning in and the fewer distractions and lapses in concentration you
            will experience.
        </p>
        <p>Open awareness is the ability to perceive the multitude of internal and external sensory input that we
            experience at any given time without being distracted by any particular input and becoming lost in thought.
            Also called open monitoring or non-directive meditation, this style of formal meditation is the opposite of
            focused attention. Instead of concentrating on something, your attention is open and remains aware of
            everything that is happening. All experiences are perceived as they happen, with a goal of remaining
            non-judgmental toward oneself. Some of the things that are watched in this meditation are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Thoughts</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Feelings</p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>

        <p>Instead of getting caught up in a thought or feeling, the practitioner is instead encouraged to simply
            witness everything and be present to whatever is happening.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> This is related to the practice of Mindfulness which has gained
            recent popularity in the West for its ability to help people have more clarity and equanimity in day-to-day
            life. For example, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has popularized mindfulness practice and helped
            millions of Americans with a practical application of mindfulness.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Jon Kabat-Zinn succinctly defines mindfulness as paying
            attention on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgmentally.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a

        <p>Dr. Siegel’s third pillar of mind training, kind intention, dovetails with Rogers’ concept of unconditional
            positive regard (see section III, above). This is about our relational sense in the world and is an
            acknowledgment of the interconnection of all things. Knowing that you are connected to all beings allows
            compassion to naturally flow. Thich Nhat Hanh coined the term “interbeing” to describe this concept.<sup
                id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <pre>Practice Tip
        </pre>
        <p>The next time you know you will be dealing with a difficult client, take a few minutes to breathe and drop in
            to the present moment prior to the meeting. There are many great meditation apps out there that can help
            with this, including <i>Insight Timer</i> and <i>Waking Up</i>. I once had a client come into my office
            shaking uncontrollably due to her fearful internal mental simulations about going to jail. I ran a brief
            three-minute meditation on my phone and it brought her back into the room, into her body, and able to
            communicate without shaking.
        </p>
        <p>Another form of meditation, which is considered the highest teaching by some ancient wisdom traditions in
            places such as Tibet,<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> is a
            direct experience of pure consciousness unencumbered by conceptual thought. In this practice there is no
            meditator, there is just being. Seeing without a seer, and hearing without a hearer, this is the ineffable
            self-transcendent experience of non-dual awareness (NDA). By turning awareness back on to itself, one can
            experience the mathematical space that is the formless source of all form. This may be what physicists call
            the “quantum vacuum.” This level of awareness has recently been introduced in the West with names such as
            Effortless Mindfulness<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> and
            Natural Awareness.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Non-duality
            is a recognition that the dualistic view of the world—inside versus outside, subject versus object, and
            other versus self—may not be accurate.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> People often experience NDA when immersed in nature, listening
            to music or playing sports. The panoramic flow state that is experienced by an athlete when they are “in the
            zone” is an expression of NDA. The DUII trial lawyer who can freely access this realm has a distinct
            advantage in the courtroom. Not only does operating from this level of awareness dissolve the narrow
            concerns of the ego-identified self, it opens the door to infinite possibility.
        </p>
        <p>The Wheel of Awareness, provided in Appendix A, is a simple meditation practice that incorporates all four of
            these concepts. Guided audio versions of the meditation are also available at <a rel="nofollow"
                class="external text" href="https://www.drdansiegel.com">drdansiegel.com</a>. The Wheel of Awareness is
            a visual metaphor with a center hub that represents awareness or consciousness itself (the context of
            consciousness), a wheel that represents all of the things awareness can know (the contents of
            consciousness), and a spoke of attention that goes from the hub to the wheel.

        <p>Practicing DUII defense can be challenging and your relationship with your clients can be one of the main
            sources of both stress and joy. We hope that the information provided in this chapter will assist you both
            in working with your client and maintaining your own well-being during the lifecycle of your DUII case. The
            Powers Principles go a long way to establishing trust and rapport with your client. The practice of
            unconditional positive regard is a way to interact with your clients in a healthy and positive way. The
            article about counseling the addicted client should provide you with some tools and information to better
            understand the plight of a client with alcohol and addiction issues. Finally, we hope that the section on
            concentration and awareness will improve your ability to be flexible and open-minded when tackling a DUII
            case, and provide one method of self-care when things seem overwhelming. Meditation is a way to experience
            what your mind is like before it becomes cluttered by concepts, judgments, reactions and other contractions
            of consciousness. A regular meditation practice is a tool that may benefit both you and your client as you
            work through the triumphs and defeats of a case. Working with DUII clients can be extremely rewarding and
            beneficial to both the attorney and the client. This is truly a practice area where the attorney has an
            opportunity to change people’s lives for the better.
